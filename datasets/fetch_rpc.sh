# Payload: download the RPC (Retail Product Checkout) dataset and cache it in
# $BUCKET/rpc/. Sourced after _fetcher_lib.sh with __BUCKET__ substituted.
#
# RPC has no single stable mirror. We probe sources in order:
#   1) The diyer22/retail-product-checkout-dataset Kaggle mirror (global, stable).
#      Requires a Kaggle API token in $BUCKET/_secrets/kaggle.json (created by user
#      via Kaggle Account -> Create New API Token).
#   2) The raw GitHub release of RPC's published assets (smaller subset; checked
#      only if Kaggle path fails).
#
# If both fail, we exit with rc=2 and the trap still cleans up the VM.
